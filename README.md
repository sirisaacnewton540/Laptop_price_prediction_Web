# Laptop Price Prediction
## Overview
This project aims to predict the prices of laptops based on various features such as company, laptop type, screen size, RAM, GPU, and more. The model is built using machine learning techniques, and the graphical user interface (GUI) is developed using Viola and ipywidgets for an interactive and user-friendly experience.

1) Features for Prediction
2) Company
3) Laptop Type
4) Screen Size
5) RAM
6) GPU
7) Operating System
8) Weight
9) Touchscreen
10) Resolution
11) CPU Frequency
12) CPU Brand
13) Storage
14) Storage Type
15) Dual Storage

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project should be included in the repository or you can provide a link to download it. Ensure the dataset is placed in the correct directory as specified in the code.

## Project Structure
1) **Laptop_Price_Prediction_Web.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
2) **requirements.txt:** List of required Python packages.
3) **laptopData.csv:** Directory containing the dataset (ensure the correct path in your notebooks).
4) **image.jpg:** IMage that has been used in the GUI to make it more visually appealing.

## Example
Here is an example of how to use the GUI:

1) Run the Laptop_Price_Prediction_Web.ipynb notebook.
2) Input the laptop features using the provided widgets.
3) Click the "Predict" button to get the predicted price of the laptop.
